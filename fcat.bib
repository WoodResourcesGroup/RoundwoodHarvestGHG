abstract = {The immediate future of biomass power production in California is secure. The renewables transition funds that are being managed by the CEC provide support for the industry throughout the course of the transition period to full deregulation, which ends on December 31, 2001. However, after the close of the transition period, the future of biomass power generation will be very uncertain. The report from Cal/EP A to the California legislature did not provide the information needed to proceed with the development of post-transition cost-shifting policies, so no further action has been taken. The legislature is on record as favoring the development of such policies, in which a clear public benefit can be demonstrated. The task at hand is to develop such a framework, and to formulate policies and measures that will allow biomass power production to be a competitive enterprise, without shifting undue costs to the beneficiaries of the environmental services provided by biomass energy generation. Failure to enact cost-shifting measures probably will lead to a major decline in the production of biomass energy, with attendant degradation of air quality and forestry health, and increasing difficulty in meeting state landfill diversion requirements. A great deal is at stake.},

abstract = {For some time there has been a proposition in forestry and nature conservation disciplines that timber plantations can potentially support natural forest conservation outcomes when wood logged in extensive natural forests is substituted by wood production from smaller areas of intensive timber plantations. Here, we have called this the plantation conservation benefit. We review evidence from the literature of this intuitively appealing proposition, both empirical and theoretical, and add emphasis on methods (theoretical modelling, econometrics and descriptive statistics) in order to explicitly address causative mechanisms and potential negative or positive feedback processes. This understanding is critical to developing effective policy. We find a convergence of conclusions of reduced degradation of natural forests associated with the expansion of timber plantations, but also potential increased deforestation due to either lower market value of natural forests in the absence of logging, or displacement effects. Yet, a main limitation of studies is the lack of consideration of the role of policies and institutions beyond market drivers, especially in econometric studies. We conclude on the need for integrated policy approaches applied simultaneously to both natural forests and plantations to maximize the potential benefit.},

abstract = {A displacement factor can express the efficiency of using biomass to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, by quantifying the amount of emission reduction achieved per unit of wood use. Here we integrate data from 21 different international studies in a meta-analysis of the displacement factors of wood products substituted in place of non-wood materials. We calculate the displacement factors in consistent units of tons of carbon (tC) of emission reduction per tC in wood product. The displacement factors range from a low of -2.3 to a high of 15, with most lying in the range of 1.0 to 3.0. The average displacement factor value is 2.1, meaning that for each tC in wood products substituted in place of non-wood products, there occurs an average GHG emission reduction of approximately 2.1 tC. Expressed in other units, this value corresponds to roughly 3.9 t CO2 eq emission reduction per ton of dry wood used. The few cases of negative displacement factors are the result of worst-case scenarios that are unrealistic in current practice. This meta-analysis quantifies the range of GHG benefits of wood substitution, and provides a clear climate rationale for increasing wood substitution in place of other products, provided that forests are sustainably managed and that wood residues are used responsibly. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The carbon (C) reservoir of wood products in Finnishconstruction and civil engineering was estimated by three inventoriesincluding the years 1980, 1990 and 1995. The inventory method ismainly based on the statistics of Finnish building stock. The use of differentconstruction materials in different parts of buildings is estimated for eachbuilding type. Information collected through building permits includes thematerials of bearing frames and facades. More information about the useof wood products in construction is gathered by many enquiries. The mixof construction materials has changed during each decade. Furthermore, thetimber stocks in construction not subject to permission and in civilengineering (e.g. bridges) were estimated. The C reservoir is calculated onthe basis of dry matter content of wooden construction materials. The timeparameters of a simple exponential decay model and a more detailed Cbalance model of wood products were calibrated to the inventory resultsusing the estimated wood flows to construction as model inputs.According to the inventories the C pool in sawn wood and wood-basedpanels of the Finnish building stock was 8.7 Tg C in 1980, 10.7 Tg C in1990 and 11.5 Tg C in 1995. The mean annual increases, 0.20 Tg Cfrom 1980 to 1990 and 0.15 Tg C from 1990 to 1995, areapproximately 1.3{\%} and 0.8{\%} of the fossil fuel C emissions in Finlandduring the same periods. When also taking into account construction notsubject to permission and civil engineering works, the estimated C stock ofwood products in Finland was 16.5 Tg C in 1995, which is about 3.3 MgC per capita and approximately 2.4{\%} of the C reservoir in Finnish forestbiomass. The total C reservoir of wood products (excluding wood wasteand paper products) coming from Finnish forests might be as much as 7{\%}of the standing biomass if exported wood products are also included. Theaverage lifetime of sawn wood in Finnish construction is less than 40 years.},

abstract = {Assessing the uncertainties in the estimates obtained from forest carbon budget models used for national and international reporting is essential, but model evaluations are rarely conducted mainly because of lack of appropriate, independent ground plot data sets. Ecosystem carbon stock estimates for 696 ground plots from Canada's new National Forest Inventory enabled the assessment of carbon stocks predicted by the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector 3 (CBM-CFS3). This model uses country-specific parameters, incorporates all five ecosystem carbon pools, and uses a simulation-based approach to predict ecosystem C stocks from forest inventory data to implement a Tier-3 (most complex) approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC-GPG). The model is at the core of Canada's National Forest Carbon Monitoring, Accounting, and Reporting System (NFCMARS). The set of ground plots meets the IPCC-GPG standard for model evaluation as it is entirely independent of the model, but similar in type to that required for IPCC Tier-3 inventory-based C stock estimation. Model simulations for each ground plot used only the type of input data available to the NFCMARS for the national inventory report in 2010 and none of the model's default parameters were altered. Ecosystem total C stocks estimated by CBM-CFS3 were unbiased (mean difference=1.9Mgha-1, p=0.397), and significantly correlated (r=0.54, p=0.000) with ground plot-based estimates. Contribution to ecosystem total C stocks error from soil was large, and from deadwood and aboveground biomass small. Results for percent error in the aboveground biomass (7.5{\%}) and IPCC defined deadwood (30.8{\%}) pools compared favourably to the IPCC-GPG standards of 8{\%} and 30{\%}, respectively. Thus, we concluded that the CBM-CFS3 is reliable for reporting of C stocks in Canada's national greenhouse gas inventories. However, available standards for judging model reliability are few, and here we provide recommendations for the development of practical standards. Analyses by leading species (n=16) showed that error could often be attributed to a small subset of species and/or pools, allowing us to identify where improvements of input data and/or the model would most contribute to reducing uncertainties. This C stock comparison is one of the first ever to follow the evaluation process recommended by the IPCC-GPG for a Tier-3 model, and is a first step towards verification of greenhouse gas emission and removal estimates based on C stock changes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {This article describes trends in three measures of lumber recovery for sawmills in the western United States: lumber overrun (LO), lumber recovery factor (LRF), and cubic lumber recovery (CLR). All states and regions showed increased LO during the last three decades. Oregon and Montana had the highest LO at 107 and 100 percent, respectively. Alaska had the lowest LO at 31 percent, followed by the Four Corners Region (i.e., Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah). Because sawmills in the western United States use the Scribner Log Rule (SLR) as the unit of log input, higher LO is not a clear indication that mills are using improved sawing technology and techniques. At best, LO is an imprecise measure of production efficiency. Better measures of lumber output per unit input include LRF and CLR. These measures are substantially better than LO because they are based on the cubic volume of solid wood fiber in a log, thus eliminating a number of the problems associated with the SLR. Oregon, followed by Washington, had the highest LRF (8.67 and 8.43 board feet lumber tally per cubic foot of logs, respectively) and the highest CLR (52{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively). Alaska had the lowest LRF and CLR. Changes in LRF and CLR suggest that sawmills in the western United States have used improved sawing technology and techniques to increase the volume of lumber recovered even as log sizes have decreased.},

abstract = {Absorption properties of smokes from laboratory fires that represent prescription burns in the Southern states have been quantified to relate variations in measured absorption parameters to variation in fire conditions and to estimate emission factors for elemental carbon. Results showed significant differences in absorption of the smoke emissions between flaming and smoldering combustion with specific absorption coefficient B(a) values ranging from 0.04 m2 g-1 for smoldering combustion to 1 m2-1 at 632.8 nm for flaming combustion. These measured optical properties and previously measured size data were used in Mie calculations to determine the overall radiative properties for the smokes from these fires. Mie calculations for ?? = 550 nm indicate that somewhat less than 50{\%} of the extinction will be due to particulate matter absorption in flaming combustion, whereas only about 5{\%} of the extinction will be due to absorption under purely smoldering conditions. Calculated mass concentration/scattering (Cm/??(s) ratios for ?? = 500 nm show only a slight variation with n(IM), decreasing from 3.3 x 105 ??g m-2 at an imaginary refractive index (n(IM)) = 0.07 to a value of 2.7 x 105 ??gm-2 at n(IM) = 0.007. The ratios calculated for the low absorption cases are generally consistent with previous experimental observations, although these calculations suggest that some of the variations seen in this ratio are consistent with variation due to differences in the optical properties of the particulates.},

abstract = {A chronosequence of three species of logs (Pinus sylvestris L., Picea abies (L.) Karst, and Betula pendula Roth.) from northwestern Russia was resampled to develop a new method to estimate rates of biomass, volume, and density loss. We call this resampling of a chronosequence the decomposition-vector method, and it represents a hybrid between the chronosequence and time-series approaches. The decomposition-vector method with a 3-year resampling interval gave decomposition rates statistically similar to those of the one-time chronosequence method. This indicated that, for most cases, a negative exponential pattern of biomass, volume, and density loss occurred. In the case of biomass loss of P. sylvestris, however, polynomial regression indicated decomposition rates were initially low, then increased, and then decreased as biomass was lost. This strongly suggests three distinct phases: the first when decomposers colonized the woody detritus, a second period of rapid exponential mass loss, and a third period of slow decomposition. The consequences for this complex pattern of decomposition were explored at the ecosystem level using a simple model. We found that a single rate constant can be used if inputs vary within a factor of 10, but that this approach is problematical if inputs are more variable.},

abstract = {Data developed by the Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials were used to estimate savings of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption associated with use of wood-based building materials in residential construction in the United States. Results indicate that houses with wood-based wall systems require 15-16{\%} less total energy for non-heating/cooling purposes than thermally comparable houses employing alternative steel- or concrete-based building systems. Results for non-renewable energy consumption are essentially the same as those for total energy, reflecting the fact that most of the displaced energy is in fossil fuels. Over a 100-year period, net greenhouse gas emissions associated with wood-based houses are 20-50{\%} lower than emissions associated with thermally comparable houses employing steel- or concrete-based building systems. Assuming 1.5 million single-family housing starts per year, the difference between wood and non-wood building systems represents about 9.6 Mt of CO2 equivalents per year. The corresponding energy benefit associated with wood-based building materials is approximately 132 PJ year-1. These estimates represent about 22{\%} of embodied energy and 27{\%} of embodied greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector of the US economy. The results of the analysis are very sensitive to assumptions and uncertainties regarding the fate of forestland that is taken out of wood production due to reduced demand for wood, the continued production of co-products where demand for wood products is reduced, and the rate at which carbon accumulates in forests. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Publishing Services Telephone (970) 498-1392 FAX (970) 498-1122 Abstract A study of commercial timber-harvesting activities in Idaho was conducted during 2008 and 2011 to characterize current tree utilization, logging operations, and changes from previous Idaho logging utilization studies. A two-stage simple random sampling design was used to select sites and felled trees for measurement within active logging sites. Thirty-three logging sites and 815 felled trees were measured. Results of the 2008/2011 study indicated that harvesting efforts removed 1,011 cubic feet (cf) of timber volume from growing stock for every 1,000 cubic feet (mcf) delivered to the mill, created 24 cf of growing-stock logging residue, and that 13 cf of non-growing-stock (stump wood and tops above 4 inches diameter outside bark (dob)) were delivered to the mill. This compared to 1,086 cf of growing-stock removals that created 95 cf of growing-stock logging residue and utilized 9 cf of non-growing-stock per mill-delivered mcf in a 1990 study. This study confirmed two long-term timber harvesting trends in Idaho: declining diameter at breast height (dbh) of harvested timber, and declining amounts of logging residue generated per unit of mill-delivered volume.},

abstract = {The complex fluxes between standing and harvested carbon stocks, and the linkage between harvested biomass and fossil fuel substitution, call for a holistic, system-wide analysis in a life-cycle perspective to evaluate the impacts of forest management and forest product use on carbon balances. We have analysed the net carbon emission under alternative forest management strategies and product uses, considering the carbon fluxes and stocks associated with tree biomass, soils, and forest products. Simulations were made using three Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest management regimes (traditional, intensive management, and intensive fertilization), three slash management practices (no removal, removal, and removal with stumps), two forest product uses (construction material and biofuel), and two reference fossil fuels (coal and natural gas). The greatest reduction of net carbon emission occurred when the forest was fertilized, slash and stumps were harvested, wood was used as construction material, and the reference fossil fuel was coal. The lowest reduction occurred with a traditional forest management, forest residues retained on site, and harvested biomass was used as biofuel to replace natural gas. Product use had the greatest impact on net carbon emission, whereas forest management regime, reference fossil fuel, and forest residue usage as biofuel were less significant.},

@article{Werner2005,
abstract = {Long-living wood products can contribute to the mitigation of climate change in many ways. On the one hand, they act as a carbon pool during their service life, as they withdraw CO2 from its natural cycle. After their service life, they can substitute for fossil fuels if they are incinerated in adequate furnaces. On the other hand, wood products can substitute for more energy intense products made of 'conventional' materials. This paper quantifies the substitution and carbon pool effects of an increased use of wood in the building sector in Switzerland for the years 2000-2130. For this purpose, life cycle data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 12 wood products and their substitutes is used as proxies for the most important groups of building products used in construction and in interior works; this data is linked to the forecasted wood flows for each group of building products in a cohort-model. For the political assessment, GHG effects occurring abroad are distinguished from GHG effects occurring in Switzerland. The results show that the C-pool effect of an increased use of wood products with long service life is of minor importance; the substitution effects associated with the thermal use of industrial and post-consumer waste wood as well as with the substitution of 'conventional' materials are much more relevant, especially on a long-term. For construction materials, the Swiss share of the GHG effect related to the material substitution is relatively high, as mainly nationally produced concrete, mineral wool, and bricks are substituted for. For products used in interior works, the Swiss share of the GHG effect related to the material substitution is rather small (or even negative for single products) because mainly imports are substituted, such as ceramic tiles or steel produced in the EU. The results are rough estimates. Nonetheless, these calculations show that an increased use of wood in the building sector is a valid and valuable option for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and for reaching GHG emission targets on a mid- to long-term basis. Still, the carbon storage and substitution capacity of an increased use of wood is relatively small compared to the overall greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.},

abstract = {Although the arboriculture industry plants and maintains trees that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, it uses heavy-duty equipment and vehicles that release more CO2 per year than other similar-sized industries in the service sector. This study used lifecycle assessment to compare CO2 emissions associated with different decisions by arborists to the amount of CO2 sequestered over 50 years for California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) planted in Los Angeles, CA. Scenarios examined effects of equipment and vehicle choices, different operational efficiencies, amounts of irrigation water applied and the fate of wood residue from pruning and tree removal. For the Highest Emission Case, total emissions (9.002 t) exceeded CO2 stored (−7.798 t), resulting in net emissions of 1.204 t. The Lowest Emission Case resulted in net removal of -3.768 t CO2 over the 50-year period. Tree selection and irrigation water management were key leverage points in Los Angeles. Converting residue from the removed tree to wood products resulted in substantially lower net CO2 emissions than did converting it into bioenergy or mulch. Although emissions from vehicles and equipment accounted for less than 6{\%} of the CO2 stored in the tree, substantial reductions are achievable. Arborists can reduce CO2 emissions threefold by converting from high- to low-emitting equipment and vehicles. By reducing travel distances and equipment run-times, twofold emission reductions are possible. Reducing the amount of aboveground biomass pruned from 20{\%} to 10{\%} every five years lowered pruning emissions fivefold.},

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidelines for countries to report greenhouse gas removals by sinks and emissions from sources. These guidelines allow use of several accounting approaches when reporting the contri- bution of harvested wood products (HWP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Using exten- sions of methods suggested by the IPCC and a software model called WOODCARB II in Microsoft Excel�, this paper presents estimates of the U.S. HWP contribution to annual greenhouse gas removals in the agriculture, forestry, land use, and land use change sector. In 2005, the contribution to removals was 30 Tg (million metric tons) C (carbon) and 31 Tg C for the Production and Atmospheric Flow Approaches, respectively, and 44 Tg C for the Stock Change Approach. This range is 17 to 25 percent of C removals by forests, or would offset 42 percent to 61 percent of residential natural gas C emissions in 2005. The contribution has declined under the Production and Atmospheric Flow Approaches since 1990 and has increased under the Stock Change Approach. The Stock Change estimate has increased because it explicitly includes C in increasing net imports of wood and paper products. The contribution estimates were validated by adjusting the half-life of products in use in order to match independent estimates of carbon in housing in 2001 and annual wood and paper discards to solid-waste disposal sites (SWDS) during 1990 to 2001. Estimates of methane emissions from wood and paper in landfills were also checked against independent estimates of total landfill methane emissions. A Monte-Carlo simulation used to assess the effect of uncertainty in inputs suggests the 90 percent confidence interval for removal contribution estimates under the three approaches is within –23{\%} to +19{\%}.},

abstract = {The transport sector emits a wide variety of gases and aerosols, with distinctly different characteristics which influence climate directly and indirectly via chemical and physical processes. Tools that allow these emissions to be placed on some kind of common scale in terms of their impact on climate have a number of possible uses such as: in agreements and emission trading schemes; when considering potential trade-offs between changes in emissions resulting from technological or operational developments; and/or for comparing the impact of different environmental impacts of transport activities. Many of the non-CO2 emissions from the transport sector are short-lived substances, not currently covered by the Kyoto Protocol. There are formidable difficulties in developing metrics and these are particularly acute for such short-lived species. One difficulty concerns the choice of an appropriate structure for the metric (which may depend on, for example, the design of any climate policy it is intended to serve) and the associated value judgements on the appropriate time periods to consider; these choices affect the perception of the relative importance of short- and long-lived species. A second difficulty is the quantification of input parameters (due to underlying uncertainty in atmospheric processes). In addition, for some transport-related emissions, the values of metrics (unlike the gases included in the Kyoto Protocol) depend on where and when the emissions are introduced into the atmosphere – both the regional distribution and, for aircraft, the distribution as a function of altitude, are important. In this assessment of such metrics, we present Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as these have traditionally been used in the implementation of climate policy. We also present Global Temperature Change Potentials (GTPs) as an alternative metric, as this, or a similar metric may be more appropriate for use in some circumstances. We use radiative forcings and lifetimes from the literature to derive GWPs and GTPs for the main transport-related emissions, and discuss the uncertainties in these estimates. We find large variations in metric (GWP and GTP) values for NOx, mainly due to the dependence on location of emissions but also because of inter-model differences and differences in experimental design. For aerosols we give only global-mean values due to an inconsistent picture amongst available studies regarding regional dependence. The uncertainty in the presented metric values reflects the current state of understanding; the ranking of the various components with respect to our confidence in the given metric values is also given. While the focus is mostly on metrics for comparing the climate impact of emissions, many of the issues are equally relevant for stratospheric ozone depletion metrics, which are also discussed.},

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2{\%}) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate.},

abstract = {In this study a method is suggested to compare the net carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the construction of concrete- and wood-framed buildings. The method is then applied to two buildings in Sweden and Finland constructed with wood frames, compared with functionally equivalent buildings constructed with concrete frames. Carbon accounting includes: emissions due to fossil fuel use in the production of building materials; the replacement of fossil fuels by biomass residues from logging, wood processing, construction and demolition; carbon stock changes in forests and buildings; and cement process reactions. The results show that wood-framed construction requires less energy, and emits less CO2 to the atmosphere, than concrete-framed construction. The lifecycle emission difference between the wood- and concrete-framed buildings ranges from 30 to 130 kg C per m2 of floor area. Hence, a net reduction of CO2 emission can be obtained by increasing the proportion of wood-based building materials, relative to concrete materials. The benefits would be greatest if the biomass residues resulting from the production of the wood building materials were fully used in energy supply systems. The carbon mitigation efficiency, expressed in terms of biomass used per unit of reduced carbon emission, is considerably better if the wood is used to replace concrete building material than if the wood is used directly as biofuel. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {This review on research on life cycle carbon accounting examines the complexities in accounting for carbon emissions given the many different ways that wood is used. Recent objectives to increase the use of renewable fuels have raised policy questions, with respect to the sustainability of managing our forests as well as the impacts of how best to use wood from our forests. There has been general support for the benefits of sustainably managing forests for carbon mitigation as expressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. However, there are many integrated carbon pools involved, which have led to conflicting implications for best practices and policy. In particular, sustainable management of forests for products produces substantially different impacts than a focus on a single stand or on specific carbon pools with each contributing to different policy implications. In this article, we review many recent research findings on carbon impacts across all stages of processing from cradle-...},

@article{Salazar2009,
abstract = {This paper examines the energy and carbon balance of two residential house alternatives; a typical wood frame home using more conventional materials (brick cladding, vinyl windows, asphalt shingles, and fibreglass insulation) and a similar wood frame house that also maximizes wood use throughout (cedar shingles and siding, wood windows, and cellulose insulation) in place of the more typical materials used - a wood-intensive house. Carbon emission and fossil fuel consumption balances were established for the two homes based on the cumulative total of three subsystems: (1) forest harvesting and regeneration; (2) cradle-to-gate product manufacturing, construction, and replacement effects over a 100-year service life; and (3) end-of-life effects - landfilling with methane capture and combustion or recovery of biomass for energy production. The net carbon balance of the wood-intensive house showed a complete offset of the manufacturing emissions by the credit given to the system for forest re-growth. Including landfill methane emissions, the wood-intensive life cycle yielded 20 tons of CO2e emissions compared to 72 tons for the typical house. The wood-intensive home's life cycle also consumed only 45{\%} of the fossil fuels used in the typical house. Diverting wood materials from the landfill at the end of life improved the life cycle balances of both the typical and wood-intensive houses. The carbon balance of the wood-intensive house was 5.2 tons of CO2e permanently removed from the atmosphere (a net carbon sink) as compared to 63.4 of total CO2e emissions for the typical house. Substitution of wood fuel for natural gas and coal in electricity production led to a net energy balance of the wood-intensive house that was nearly neutral, 87.1 GJ energy use, 88{\%} lower than the scenario in which the materials were landfilled. Allocating biomass generation and carbon sequestration in the forest on an economic basis as opposed to a mass basis significantly improves the life cycle balances of both houses. Employing an economic allocation method to the forest leads to 3-5 times greater carbon sequestration and fossil fuel substitution attributable to the house, which is doubled in forestry regimes that remove stumps and slash as fuel. Thus, wood use has the potential to create a significantly negative carbon footprint for a house up to the point of occupancy and even offset a portion of heating and cooling energy use and carbon emissions; the wood-intensive house is energy and carbon neutral for 34-68 years in Ottawa and has the potential to be a net carbon sink and energy producer in a more temperate climate like San Francisco. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Particulate black or elemental carbon (EC) (black carbon [BC]) and organic carbon (OC) affect climate; visibility, and human health. Several "top-down" and "bottom-up" global emission inventories for these components have compiled country-wide emission factors, source profiles, and activity levels that do not necessarily reflect local conditions. Recent estimates of global BC and OC emissions range from 8 to 24 and 33 to 62 Tg (10(12) g) per year, respectively. U.S. BC emissions account for 5.6{\%} of the global total emissions. Uncertainties in global BC emission estimates are a factor of 2 or more. The U.S. National Emissions Inventory is well documented, but its major source categories are not easily related to EC- and OC-emitting source subcategories. California's bottom-up emission inventory is easily accessible at many levels of detail and provides an example of how sources can be regrouped for speciated emission rates. PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters {\textless}2.5 mu m) emissions from these categories are associated with EC and OC source profiles to generate California's speciated emissions. A BC inventory for California of 38,731 t/yr was comparable to the 33,281 t/yr estimated from a bottom-up global BC inventory. However, further examination showed substantial differences among subcategories, with the global inventory BC from fossil fuel combustion at two-thirds that from the California inventory and the remainder attributed to biomass burning. Major discrepancies were found for directly emitted OC, with the global inventory estimating more than twice that of the California inventory. Most of the discrepancy was due to differences in open biomass burning (wildfires and agricultural waste) for which carbon emissions are highly variable. BC and OC emissions are sensitive to the availability and variability of existing source profiles, and profiles more specific to fuels and operating conditions are needed to increase emission accuracy.},

abstract = {A wide range of globally significant biomass fuels were burned during the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4). A multi-channel photoacoustic absorption spectrometer (PAS) measured dry absorption at 405, 532, and 660{\&}thinsp;nm and thermally denuded (250{\&}thinsp;{\&}deg;C) absorption at 405 and 660{\&}thinsp;nm. Absorption coefficients were broken into contributions from black carbon (BC), brown carbon (BrC) and lensing following three different methodologies, with one extreme being a method that assumes the thermal denuder effectively removes organics and the other extreme being a method based on the assumption that black carbon (BC) has an angstrom exponent of unity. The methodologies employed provide ranges of potential importance of BrC to absorption but, on average, there was a factor of 2 difference in the ratio of the fraction of absorption attributable to brown carbon estimated by the two methods. BrC absorption at shorter visible wavelengths is of equal or greater importance to that of BC with maximum contributions of up to 92{\&}thinsp;{\%} of total aerosol absorption at 405{\&}thinsp;nm and up to 58{\&}thinsp;{\%} of total absorption at 532{\&}thinsp;nm. Lensing is estimated to contribute a maximum of 30{\&}thinsp;{\%} of total absorption, but typically contributes much less than this. Absorption enhancements and the estimated fraction of absorption from BrC show good correlation with the elemental to organic carbon ratio (EC/OC) of emitted aerosols and weaker correlation with the modified combustion efficiency (MCE). Previous studies have shown that brown carbon grows darker (larger imaginary refractive index) as the ratio of black to organic aerosol (OA) mass increases. This study is consistent with those findings but also demonstrates that the fraction of total absorption attributable to BrC shows the opposite trend: increasing as the organic fraction of aerosol emissions increases and the EC/OC ratio decreases.},
