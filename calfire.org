* California Forest Management Emissions Profile

Forest management activities in California produce logs for lumber markets while maintaining and enhancing forest health. In addition to merchantable logs, these harvest activities produce logging residuals that are either left in the stand to decompose, or pile burned as directed by forest practice rules ([[http://calfire.ca.gov/resource_mgt/downloads/2013_FP_Rulebook_with_Tech_RuleNo1.pdf][California Forest Practice Rules]], Article 7 §
917.2). The extent to which these residuals are utilized avoiding open combustion or decomposition materially impacts emissions of \ac{GHG} and \ac{SLCP}..

The majority of biomass produced from forest management activities end up as residual biomass material that is either left in the woods to decompose, or aggregated at a landing where it is eventually burned. When considered alongside the accumulation of woody material from historic fire suppression activity, there exists a heightened volume of combustible woody material in excess of historic reference conditions, elevating the risk of damaging wildfire in much of California’s forestland. Currently, common practice for fuel load management in California forests involves prescribed natural fire and sanitation pile burning. However, these approaches have limitations as previous studies have demonstrated that prescribed natural fire is often only effective at reducing fuel loading and maintaining fire resilient landscapes when it is coupled with mechanical treatment to remove biomass cite:Stephens2009c. Open pile burning of residual biomass can also result in greater emissions of strong radiative forcing agents (black carbon) and criteria air pollutants such as \ac{PM} and \ac{NOX} when compared to controlled combustion in biomass power plants with modern emissions control technology. 

Ultimately, any combustion or decomposition of residual material results in emissions of \ac{GHG}, \ac{CAP}, and \ac{SLCP}. In the absence of forest management activity, atmospheric emissions are produced from stochastic processes such as wildfire, pest, and disease outbreaks. Utilization strategies are necessary to reduce the air quality impact of common forestry practice. The high climate opportunity cost[fn:4] of open burning residual biomass in forestry and agriculture favor diverting residual material streams towards alternative utilization strategies such as biomass power. Figure ref:fig:wood_fates presents an overview of emissions and emissions reduction pathways for wood from California's forests.

The focus of this analysis is on deriving the net \ac{CO2e} emissions and emissions reductions associated with *management activity*. This report does not assess greenhouse gas emissions from pest or disease induced mortality, which is estimated at approximately 34 MMT of \ac{CO2e} annually in California forests cite:Christensen2016. Emissions from mortality are indirectly related to management activities just as wildfire is, and must be accounted for to comprehensively evaluate the climate impacts of harvesting. To estimate emissions and reductions by forest  management activity, it is necessary to take the following steps:

1. Estimate \ac{CO2e} emissions from burning forest management
   residuals using the \ac{CARB}, \ac{CAP} and \ac{GHG} emissions inventories.

2. Estimate the volume and fate of wood that is removed, left in the
   forest, and burned as a result of direct anthropogenic management
   activities.

3. Establish life-cycle \ac{DF} for all
   utilized wood and apply \ac{DF} to harvested wood to obtain an aggregate estimate to estimate emissions reductions from wood use.

** Report Objectives

Quantifying the climate effects of wood products and forest management
residuals is important to the development of the \ac{FCP} [fn:1] as well as efforts underway by the \ac{BOF} and CalFire to meet the intent of AB 1504 (2010)[fn:2]. To
inform these efforts, this report provides estimates of the following:

 - Statewide \ac{GHG} and \ac{SLCP} emissions produced from the combustion or
   decomposition of logging residuals.
 - Statewide \ac{GHG} emissions reductions from the use of wood products harvested in
   the state.


Estimates are based empirical data and reflect past forest
management activities. It is *critical* to note that the empirical
data used in this analysis reflect point-in-time measures that are
affected by a dynamic system of climate, growth, and mortality as well as macroeconomic and policy forces. This analysis may provide insight into
opportunities to more effectively utilize woody biomass residuals from
current forest management activities to reduce emissions. 

** Key Findings
- Baseline \ac{GHG} and \ac{SLCP} emissions from burning of forest
  management residuals can be estimated and should be considered in
  any forest management emissions baseline.

- Total emissions from pile burning of forest management residuals
  (including \ac{SLCP} and \ac{GHG} components) extrapolated from CARB emissions
  inventory are estimated at *2.5 MTCO2e*

- Wood harvested in California in 2012 resulted in avoided emissions of
  *2.29 MMTCO2e*

- Logging residuals not used in bioenergy production contributed annual
  emissions of:
  - *XXX MMTCO2e* resulting from anthropogenic burning of logging residuals

  - *XXX MMTCO2e* resulting from decomposition of logging residuals left
    unburned

- Un-utilized slash from non-commercial management activities on
  National Forest System lands contributed emissions of XXX MMTCO2e

- Forest Inventory and Analysis re-sample data has been used in the
  southeast to quantify removals resulting from non-commercial
  management activity and could be used for this purpose in California

- The [[https://ssl.arb.ca.gov/pfirs/][Prescribed Fire Information Reporting System]] (PFIRS) may be a useful tool for quantifying
  emissions from pile burns and prescribed fire. It is a requirement that prescribed fires and pile
  burns on National Forest System Lands are reported through PFIRS. However, California Air Quality Management
  Districts are not required to report emissions through this system at this time. Therefore, it is not possible to associate burns in the PFIRS with commercial harvest activities.

- Brown or (\ac{OC}) carbon has stronger radiative absorption than \ac{BC} and is associated with biomas burning. Accouting for anthropogenic production of \ac{OC} whould be included in emissions baselines against which alternative utilization (energy) should be measured against.

* Estimating CO2 Equivalent Emissions from In-Forest Biomass Combustion


The \ac{CARB} reports on emissions from in-forest biomass combustion with current \ac{GHG} and \cap{CAP} [[http://www.arb.ca.gov/ei/ei.htm][emissions inventories]]. Both are necessary resources for establishing aggregate annual climate-forcing emissions. 
The GHG inventory captures
gasses with radiative forcing properties including CO2 and CH4, but does not capture elemental
carbon or black carbon (BC) emissions which also have strong radiative
forcing properties (Table ref:tab:bc_gwp). The citet:CaliforniaAirResourcesBoard2015,CaliforniaAirResourcesBoard2016
CAP report captures SLCP emissions from wildfire
(src_python{return(0.66*122)} MMTCO2e) and prescribed fire
(src_python{return(0.03*122)} MMTCO2e) from which black carbon emissions may be estimated. However, no reference in the CAP report is made to the source of these
SLCP estimates. When viewed in aggregate, a comprehensive reporting of total climate impact from anthropogenic burning may be estimated. 


The \ac{GHG} inventory captures
gasses with radiative forcing properties including CO2 and CH4, but does not capture elemental
carbon or \ac{BC} emissions which also have strong radiative
forcing properties (Table ref:tab:bc_gwp).

** Estimating /Black Carbon/ Emissions from Biomass Burning


\acf{BC} is not directly reported by statewide emissions summaries.\ac{BC} is a fraction of the \ac{TC) component measured in particulate matter (PM 2.5). \ac{PM} emissions are published annually by \ac{CARB} ([[http://www.arb.ca.gov/ei/emissiondata.htm][Criteria air pollutant (CAP) emissions estimates]]). 
By using the 2015 CAP emissions estimates shown in Table ref:arb_pm_ann with estimated ratios of 
smoldering to flaming combustion for hand/machine piled burns, prescribed 
natural fire and wildfire from citet:Ward1989, Black Carbon emissions
can be calculated from PM

Given the variance in \ac{BC} production from smoldering (\pm 49\%) and flaming (\pm 45\%) phases (Table ref:tab:bc_pm), actual emissions of \ac{BC}  may vary substantially depending on combustion. In addtion to these estimates cite:Chow2010 provides an alternative source for estimates of \ac{BC} and \ac{OC} emissions in the state in 2006. Further work is necessary to evaluate the impacts of \ac{OC} on the net \ac{CO2e} emissions from pile burning. cite:Pokhrel2016 estimated the absorptive properties of \ac{OC} to be 1.5 - 2.5 that of \ac{BC}. cite:Chow2010 estimated that on 2006 29,530 Mt of \ac{OC} was emitted from wildfires.

** Estimating \ac{GHG} Emissions from Biomass Burning
   The \ac{CARB} GHG emissions inventory resolved to combustion source (piles, prescribed, etc.) for forests and rangelands has not been updated since 2004. To provide a comparable estimate of GHG emissions from pile burning we use the ratio of \ac{PM} to the net \ac{CO2e} emissions from all \ac{GHG} species produced from the Piled Fuels Eissions Calculator (CONSUME model equations) sources two approaches are taken. As \ac{PM} is reported in the \ac{CAP} for pile burning we can apply this ratio to estimate \ac{GHG} emissions for the same time period.


To estimate \ac{GHG} emissions from *pile burning*, we use the ratio of
PM 2.5 to CO2 and to CH4 from the Piled Fuels Emissions Calculator. These ratios are then applied to CARB-reported PM emissions to estimate \ac{GHG} emissions (Table ref:tab:pfe_calc).

** Estimating Total Emissions from Biomass Burning
To arrive at an estimate of total CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions for 2015, 
we combine \ac{BC} emissions estimates from the \ac{CARB}
Criteria Air Pollutant Emissions Inventory with GHG emissions estimates reported in the
CARB GHG Emissions Inventory and the CONSUME model. The time discrepancy between the most recent GHG Emissions Inventory in 2004 and the current year is
acknowledged as an irreconcilable source of uncertainty in this
estimation. The use of the COMSUME moel to predict pile buring emissions is likely more reliable and as pile buring is a central focus of this analysis we confidently use the emissions estimated here for pile burning thourghout. Model-based estimation could be used to derive a ratio of \ac{GHG} to PM using the [[http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/research/smoke/consume/index.shtml][USFS CONSUME]] model. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that substantial emissions from forest management residuals have been reported by CARB emissions inventories and that such inventories could be utilized to establish a baseline condition (Table ref:tab:pile_summary).

* Estimating Emissions Impact from Utilization of Harvested Wood
Wood harvested from California's forests are utilized in a variety of construction,
landscaping, and consumer products. During the manufacture of these products, this wood is fractionated 
through a multi-stage process of harvesting, processing, and utilization to reside in several residual biomass fates (below). 

+ Logging Residuals :: Tops, limbs, and sub-merchantable material produced from harvest activities in the woods. These residuals may be left on site to naturally decompose or be combusted through controlled pile burning or wildfire.
+ Processing (Mill) Residuals :: Sawdust, shavings, bark, and off cuts from primary and secondary manufacturing. These residuals may be directed towards alternative product streams (i.e. wood pellet, wood chip, power and heat generation) or sent to a landfill.
+ Construction Debris :: Fraction of wood used in construction or finished products that are not integratrated into its final form. These residuals are most commonly sent to a landfill.
+ Demolition :: Wood used in construction that has reached the end of its useful life. These residuals are most commonly sent to a landfill.

These biomass fates have widely variable time horizons for carbon return to the atmosphere which can greatly influence the net emissions impact attributed to the initial forest management activity. While wood products used in construction, finished products, or other stable environments may sequester carbon for a long period, residues sent to landfills or left in the woods as slash emit climate forcing gasses to the atmosphere. Some of these wood residues may be redirected towards alternative controlled combustion applications (i.e., pellet production, power and heat generation)to avoid emissions. To assess the full emissions impact of harvested wood in California, we estimate total emissions from wood residues and displacement impact of wood product applications. 

Ultimately the fate of these pools are determined by a highly dynamic political and economic system. To understand how policy decisions will impact the fate and subsequent climate impact of forest management, a detailed process model is necessary to track the distribution of harvested wood material.

To provide a rough estimate of the fate of annually harvested roundwood material, we estimate the volume of wood biomass residing in Logging, Processing, and Construction 
residuals. To estimate current values, we apply known milling efficiency 
improvements, logging utilization rates, and construction use efficiency to historical production volumes. 
*** Logging Residues
 According to citet:Morgan, logging residues produced from sawlog harvest can be estimated using a factor of 0.0302 (+/-.0123 @95%CI) times the total cubic sawlog volume delivered to a mill. citet:Simmons2014 found that logging utilization has decreased in Idaho from 1990 to 2011 by 72%. Unfortunately, we cannot say how logging residue production has changed over time in California. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that similar changes have occurred in California timber harvesting. 

 We estimate logging residue production factor for years before 1990 based on the following equation. We assume 1990 residue ratios for all years prior.

 #+BEGIN_LaTeX

 \begin{align*}
 V\llap{--}lr_{x} = V\llap{--}rw_{x}\left(\eta_{04}+\left(\eta_{o4}\eta_\Delta\right)\right)\\
 \text{Where:}\\
 V\llap{--}rw_{x} = \text{Rundwood volume harvested in year }x\\
 \eta_{04} = \mathcal{N}(0.0302,0.0123) \text{ ratio of logging residues to roundwood harvested in CA, 2004}\\
 \eta_\Delta = 0.72 \text{ (percent change in efficiency over time period)}\\
 \end{align*}
 #+END_LaTeX

 For logging residue production factors between 1990 and 2004, we calculate logging residues by adjusting the logging residual ratio reported by citet:Morgan with the percent change in logging residual ratios estimated for Idaho by citet:Simmons2014. To reflect the uncertainty in the estimate provided by citet:Morgan, we calculate the logging residual using a randomly selected value from a normal probability distribution defined by the estimate and upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval provided:

 #+BEGIN_LaTeX

 \begin{align*}
 V\llap{--}lr_{x} = V\llap{--}rw_{x}\left(\eta_{04}+ \left(\eta_{04}\left(\left(Y_1-x\right)\frac{\eta_\Delta}{Y_\Delta}\right)\right)\right)\\
 \text{Where:}\\
 V\llap{--}rw_{x} = \text{Roundwood volume harvested in year }x\\
 \eta_{04} = \mathcal{N}(0.0302,0.0123) \text{ ratio of logging residues to roundwood harvested in CA, 2004}\\
 Y_1 = 2004 \text{ (year for which logging residual estimate available for CA)} \\
 x = \text{year for which logging residues are calculated}\\
 \eta_\Delta = 0.72 \text{ (percent change in logging residue ratio over time period)}\\
 Y_\Delta = 21\text{ (number of years over which logging residue ratio decreased)}
 \end{align*}
 #+END_LaTeX

 Logging residual volume in years following 2004 are calculated as follows:

 #+BEGIN_LaTeX
 \begin{align*}
 V\llap{--}lr_{x} = V\llap{--}rw_{x}\left(\eta_{04}- \left(\eta_{04}\left(\left(x-Y_1\right)\frac{\eta_\Delta}{Y_\Delta}\right)\right)\right)\\
 \text{Where:}\\
 V\llap{--}rw_{x} = \text{Rundwood volume harvested in year }x\\
 \eta_{04} = \mathcal{N}(0.0302,0.0123) \text{ ratio of logging residues to roundwood harvested in CA, 2004}\\
 Y_1 = 2004 \text{ (year for which logging residual estimate available for CA)} \\
 x = \text{year for which logging residues are calculated}\\
 \eta_\Delta = 0.72 \text{ (percent change in logging residue ratio over time period)}\\
 Y_\Delta = 21\text{ (number of years over which logging residue ratio decreased)}
 \end{align*}

*** Processing Residues
 Milling efficiency has increased by roughly 14% in California in the period between 1970 and 2006 citet:Keegan2010. For this analysis we assume a continuous improvement such that for years prior to 1970, milling efficiency in year $x$ is calculated as:

 #+BEGIN_LaTeX

 \begin{align*}
 V\llap{--}mr_{x} = V\llap{--}rw_{x} \left(\eta_{70}-\left((Y_1-x)\frac{\eta_\Delta}{Y_\Delta}\right\right)\\
 \text{Where:}\\
 V\llap{--}rw_{x} = \text{Rundwood volume harvested in year }x\\
 \eta_{70} = 0.42 \text{ (milling efficiency in 1970)}\\
 Y_1 = 1970 \text{ (earliest year mill efficiency available for)} \\
 x = \text{year for which milling residues are calculated}\\
 \eta_\Delta = 0.06\text{ (increase in milling efficiency from 1970-2011)}\\
 Y_\Delta = 41\text{ (number of years overwhihc milling efficiency increased)}
 \end{align*}
 #+END_LaTeX

For years after 1970, milling efficiency for year $x$ is calculated as:

 #+BEGIN_LaTeX
 \begin{align*}
 V\llap{--}mr_{x} = V\llap{--}rw_{x} \left(\eta_{70}+\left((x-Y_1)\frac{\eta_\Delta}{Y_\Delta}\right\right)\\

*** Construction Residues
To estimate annualized construction waste material, we apply the ratio of construction and demolition debris to finished wood products (citet:McKeever2004) to Board of Equalization (BOE) citet:??? roundwood harvest volumes. In 2002, construction debris was estimated as approximately 15% of the total wood used in construction. Of note is that the data from citeauthor:McKeever2004 is sparse and should be considered unreliable for years other than those for which it is reported. 

*** Demolition Debris 
Debris from wood produced from wood grown on California forestland is outside of the scope of this report.

The following Table ref:tab:me_and_lr presents ten year average estimates of logging and milling residuals, finished lumber, and construction debris based on Board of Equalization (BOE) roundwood harvest volumes.

** Emissions from Un-Utilized Residues
label:sec:boe_lr_emiss

Residuals not utilized in bioenergy applications or sent to a landfill eventually 
produce emmisions through combustion or biological decomposition of the
material over time. Most of these residues originate from logging activity.  
To calculate \ac{CO2e} emissions from un-utilized residues, I first estimate the total volume of biomass 
pile burned in forests using the CARB estimate of PM. Then, by comparing total volume of pile burned and bioenergy diverted biomass against the 
total biomass volume from the \ac{TPO}, I resolve the remaining biomass volume as emitted through decomposition.  

*** Emissions from Pile Burns of Un-utilized Biomass Residuals: 

To estimate total biomass from PM2.5, I assume 90% consumption of biomass in piles and use the relationship of pile tonnage to PM emissions as calculated from the [[http://depts.washington.edu/nwfire/piles/][Piled Fuels Biomass and Emissions Calculator]] provided by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. This calculator is based on the [[http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/research/smoke/consume/index.shtml][Consume]] fire behavior model published by the US Forest Service. The ratio of PM to unburned tonnage of biomass used below is src_python{return(0.008236/1.360178)}. Ratio of PM2.5 to consumed fuel is src_python{return(0.008236/1.224161)}.

*** Emissions from Decomposition of Un-Utilized Forest Management Residuals:

Un-utilized residual biomass not consumed in pile burns decomposes over
time resulting in CH4  and CO2 emissions. To provide a
full picture of the emissions from residual material produced from
commercial timber harvesting in California, we must account for decomposition 
of unutilized logging residuals left on-site that are not burned. To establish
 the fraction of logging residue that is left to
decompose, residues burned and used in bioenergy are subtracted from the
total reported by the TPO:

# [[# http://mathurl.com/h5ns5j4.png]]
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{align*}
LR_d &= LR - LR_{piles} - LR_{bio} \\
\text{where:}\\
LR_d &= \text{Logging residuals subject to anerobic decomposition} \\
LR &= \text{Total logging residue reported by TPO}\\
LR_{piles} &= \text{Logging residues combusted in anthropogenic pile burns}\\
LR_{bio} &= \text{Logging residues used to produce bioenergy}
\end{align*}

#+END_LaTeX
To calculate the \ac{GHG} emissions from decomposition of piles, we use the
following equation.

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{align*}
CO_2e_{decomp} &= \left(LR_d \times C_{LR} \times CO2_{ratio} \right) + \left(LR_d \times C_{LR} \times CH_4_{ratio}\times GWP_{CH_4}\right)\\
\text{where:}\\
CO_2e_{decomp} &= \text{Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from decomposition of logging slash}\\
C_{LR} &= \text{Carbon fraction of biomass: 0.5}\\
CO2_{ratio} &= \text{Fraction of carbon released as } CO_2\text{: 0.61}\\
CH_4_{ratio} &= \text{Fraction of carbon released as } CH_4\text{: 0.09}\\

** Emissions of Residuals from non-commercial managenent Activity

# Residues from non-commercial management activities are assumed to
# be small in comparison with commercial logging residues. In addition, there is
# presently no empirical data available. As such, estimating these volumes
# has not been prioritied. I have attempted to provide an estimate for management
# activity on 
# public lands in the National Forest System here.

The /as{TPO} database in California does not report wood volume produced from
non-commercial management activities. This includes management
activities such as pre-commercial thinning, sanitation thinning, and
fuels reduction thinning. To estimate the volume of material produced
from these activities we use the following sources:

1. *Public lands:* The USFS Forest Service Activity Tracking System
   (FACTS) reports management activities conducted on National Forest
   System Lands. To ensure estimates of biomass volume using FACTS are
   not duplicative of reported volume in the TPO a series of filters are
   applied to the FACTS attributes to identify only non-commercial
   management activities.


Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS)


Data from TPO does not account for forest management activities that do
not result in commercial products (timber sales, biomass sales). The
USFS
[[http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetParent=Activities][reports]]
Hazardous Fuels Treatment (HFT) activities as well as Timber Sales (TS)
derived from the FACTS database. I use these two data sets to estimate
the number of acres treated that did not produce commercial material
(sawlogs or biomass) and where burning was not used. The first step is
to eliminate all treatments in the HFT data set that included timber
sales. I accomplish this by eliminating all rows in the HFT data set
that have identical =FACTS_ID= fields in the TS dataset. I further
filter the HFT dataset by removing any planned but not executed
treatments (=nbr_units1 >0= below -- =nbr_units1= references
=NBR_UNITS_ACCOMPLISHED= in the USFS dataset, see metadata for HFT
[[http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_HazFuelTrt_PL.xml][here]]),
and use text matching in the 'ACTIVITY' and 'METHOD' fields to remove
any rows that contain reference to 'burning' or 'fire'. Finally, we
remove all rows that that reference 'Biomass' in the method category as
it is assumed that this means material was removed for bioenergy.I use a
range of 10-35 BDT/acre (mean 22.5) to convert acres reported in FACTS to volume.
The following table presents descriptive statistics for estimates of
residual unutilized wood biomass on an annual basis in million cubic
feet.

** Avoided Emissions from Wood Product Displacement Factors

For each product application, wood may be substituted by a range of other materials. In
residential construction for example, precast concrete and structural steel framing
are competitive alternatives to wood. This choice of materials has a profound impact on \ac{GHG} emissions in the
construction sector and is expressed as a displacement
factor (DF). A displacement factor quantifies the amount of emissions
reduction achieved per unit of wood used. The displacement factors published in
citep:Sathre2010 and used in this analysis are based on the
following emission reduction sources:

1. *Reduced emissions from manufacturing:* Wood products require less total
   energy than to manufacture than products made from alternative materials.
2. *Avoided process emissions:* Production of wood alternatives such as cement are associated with 
   substantial CO2 emissions.
3. *Carbon storage in products:* Carbon in harvested wood is drawn from
   the atmosphere through photosynthesis and will remain fixed through
   the useful life of the wood product.
4. *Carbon storage in forests:* Forests producing wood continue to grow.
   It is assumed that forests producing wood in California are managed
   to sustain forest growth (not converted to non-forest land uses).
5. *Avoided fossil fuel emissions due to bioenergy substitution:*
   Logging and milling residuals used to produce energy avoid emissions
   from fossil energy sources in the energy sector.
6. *Carbon dynamics in landfills:* A fraction of carbon from wood
   deposited in landfills remains in semi-permanent storage.
   The remainder is converted to methane through biological
   decomposition in the landfill. Capture and use of the methane as an
   energy source, in turn reduces emissions from fossil energy sources.

A meta analysis conducted by citep:Sathre2010 compared empirical analysis from 21 international studies and found an
average emissions reduction of 2.1 tons of carbon (3.9 t CO2e) per ton
of dry wood used. While studies ranged substantially around the average, the
authors found that the majority of published displacement factors ranged
between 1 and 3 tC/t dry wood. 

*** Applying Displacement Factors to California Wood Harvest Volume

To evaluate the climate impact of harvested wood in California, I used
harvested roundwood estimates from the Timber Products Output (TPO)
database[fn:3]. I used two estimates of the DF applied
to the harvested wood reported in the TPO based on whether logging
residuals were used in bioenergy or left in the woods (to decompse or
burn).

Figure ref:fig:flow_chart reflects the flow of wood
from Californias forest to its fate in-use and is the frame of
reference for the following analysis.

# [[https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/fb78eea4-7fba-4a78-8e98-25fdd66a3df2/image.png]]

I applied displacement factors reported by cite:Sathre2010 to the
reported harvest volumes from the TPO database. 


The following references are used to
arrive at an average displacement factor of *2.625* tCO2e/t finished
wood product for harvested roundwood without
logging residue utilization.

For harvested roundwood with logging residue utilization the following
studies are used. I used an average of the DF reported here of *3.243* tCO2e/t finished
wood product.

The TPO reports values in terms of roundwood harvested for products, but the
displacement factors presented in Sathre and O'Connor are in terms of
tons of carbon in wood products. Therefore we must assume a milling
efficiency to convert TPO volume estimates to finished wood product volume. I assumed
a milling efficiency of 0.5.


Further, TPO is reported in cubic feet and the DF implies a mass
unit. To convert cubic meters to a mass unit, we used the average wood
density of harvested volume in California weighted by species as reported 
in citet:Mciver2012. The resulting weighted average wood density used here is *27.94
lbs/cuft*.


Using the McIver and Morgan, we determine the percent of harvested wood used in bioenergy
feedstocks. From personal communications with
[[http://www.bber.umt.edu/staff/mciver.asp][Chelsea McIver]], all bioenergy feedstock reported is sourced in-woods (ie, not mill
residues).

In addition to the TPO, the California Board of Equalization (BOE) also
reports historic timber harvest volumes.  Comparing between years where both
sources report data, the BOE database reports on average, 8% less volume than the TPO (Table ref:tab:tpo_boe) database. This is reasonable considering that:
1. BOE data may be under-reported, as there may be a financial incentive to reduce tax burden
2. BOE does not include volume harvested from native American tribal lands in the state

To use the TPO data to estimate emissions reductions using the DF, we apply a
conversion factor of *5.44* MCF/MMBF. This is an approximation as the
actual sawlog conversion factor varies with average harvested log size, which has changed over time.  


Using the ratio of logging residuals consumed by bioenergy (mciver), to the total logging residuals reported in the TSP, we can calculated the harvest volume the ratio of harvest volume to logging residuals used in bioenergy,
we calculateted 
based on the ratio of reported consumption of logging residuals in
bioenergy by citeauthor:Mciver2012 to the total logging residuals reported
in the TPO. citeauthor:Mciver2012 report bioenergy consumption from 2000
forward. For years previous, we use the average bioenergy consumption
from 2000 -- 2012. These results assume bioenergy consumption
throughout the reporting years. Bioenergy use of residuals did not
begin until the late 1970. Further analysis is necessary to modify
these results to reflect the development of the bioenergy industry.

To calculate the total emissions reduction resulting from California's
timber harvest, we apply the appropriate displacement factor (with or
without logging residual utilization) to the commensurate fraction of
harvested roundwood. The results are shown in the following chart.

* Further Questions

This analysis is a first step towards a broader analysis of the
climate impacts of harvested wood in California. The following are key
questions which follow from this analysis.
